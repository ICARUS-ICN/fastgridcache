Fast In-Axis Cache Placement Algorithm for Grid-Like NDN Networks 
===

Overview
---

This is a tool to compute the optimal cache locations in a grid-like topology assuming 
that the caches are to be placed in the axis and that there is a producer at the center
of the grid.

The behavior of the in-axis placement strategy is to be described in a forthcoming academic article.
